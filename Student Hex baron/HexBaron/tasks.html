		This question refers to the <strong>PlayGame</strong> subroutine in the main program. <br /><br />
		
		The commands input by the player are already converted to lower case, which makes them case-insensitive.  However, sometimes a player may additionally or accidentally type a space at the beginning or end of their command – currently this often causes an invalid command.  Change the same line of code that converts them to lower case to also remove any leading or trailing spaces; feel free to use your own subroutine for this, or a built-in subroutine.<br /><br />		
		
		Test that the change you have made works:

				<ul><li>"move 8 16 "</li>

		This question refers to the <strong>CheckCommandIsValid</strong> and <strong>SetUpDefaultGame</strong> subroutines and a new  <strong>CheckSpawnCommandFormat</strong> subroutine in the main program, to a new <strong>BombPiece</strong> class, to the <strong>Piece</strong> class and to the <strong>ExecuteSpawnCommand</strong>, <strong>DestroyPiecesAndCountVPs</strong>, <strong>GetPieceTypeInTile</strong> and <strong>ExecuteMoveCommand</strong> methods in the <strong>HexGrid</strong> class. <br /><br />

		Develop a Bomb piece.  The bomb can only be spawned by the Baron but should look like a Serf piece. It costs 10 lumber to spawn and 2 fuel for each space that it moves regardless of the terrain. <br /><br />
		
		When the bomb explodes it will destroy all pieces in the hexes adjacent to the hex containing the bomb.  It will explode if two pieces are adjacent to it (as per normal attacks), but the bomb has a further ability.   <br /><br />
		
		Once the bomb has moved five spaces it is immobilised and becomes ‘primed’: any piece newly entering (even in the middle of a move) one of the hexes surrounding the bomb will cause it to explode.  The bomb will not explode if it is primed next to an existing piece (but of course it will if primed next to two existing pieces), only if another piece enters a hex next to it, kind of like a motion detector.  <br /><br />
		
		The command is a modification of the spawn command, so now spawn can optionally take a second argument of bomb, e.g. spawn bomb NUM would spawn a bomb at NUM if NUM is adjacent to the Baron, and spawn NUM would operate as normal.  The bomb has a VP value of 5, meaning that when it explodes, the opposing player receives 5 VPs.

		<ul>
			<li>Modify the <strong>CheckCommandIsValid</strong> subroutine to make the new spawn command function correctly.</li>
			<li>Create a new subroutine called  <strong>CheckSpawnCommandFormat</strong> that is called from the modified <strong>CheckCommandIsValid</strong> to make sure that the new spawn bomb command is valid.</li>
			<li>Modify the private method <strong>ExecuteSpawnCommand</strong> so that it will spawn a bomb and charge the player 10 lumber or report an error if they don’t have enough lumber.</li>
			<li>Create a new <strong>BombPiece</strong> class for the bomb.</li>
			<li>Modify the method <strong>DestroyPiecesAndCountVPs</strong> so that if a bomb is destroyed then it explodes and destroys the surrounding pieces too.</li>
			<li>Modify the method <strong>GetPieceTypeInTile</strong> for <strong>HexGrid</strong> so that the bomb piece appears as a Serf when the board is displayed.</li>
			<li>Modify the private method <strong>ExecuteMoveCommand</strong> so that it checks whether the player moved next to a primed bomb, and explodes the bomb if it did.</li>
			<li>Modify the <strong>Piece</strong> class to add an <strong>Explode</strong> method so that it can be destroyed at the end of the turn in case a bomb was set off during the turn.</li>
			<li>Modify the <strong>SetUpDefaultGame</strong> subroutine so that both players start with 30 of each resource:

<pre>Player1 = Player("Player One", 0, 30, 30, 5)
Player2 = Player("Player Two", 1, 30, 30, 5)</pre>

		Introduce a new piece, a Wizard which can teleport a distance of three spaces but only once per turn; this costs 5 fuel. It can also move one square for a cost of 1 fuel.  The piece can be created by upgrading a Serf using the new command upgrade wiz NUM, where NUM is the location of a hex containing a Serf. To move the wizard, you simply use the move command as normal and if the distance is two or three squares then it teleports, if it is one square then it moves normally and if it is more than three squares then it is an invalid move.  The wizard should be displayed with W for Player One and w for Player Two and should have a VP value of 3.

		<ul>

The syntax for the upgrade is “upgrade scfw NUM” where NUM is the location of the Serf to be upgraded. Once created, the piece is displayed as F for Player1 and f for Player2. A new command will be available “supply NUM”, which will take all three of your moves (so it can only be the first command), will cost 5 lumber and 5 fuel and will add 1 to your supply chain; NUM is the location of the factory. The VP value of the factory is 3. The factory cannot be moved once created.

		This question refers to the <strong>DisplayMainMenu</strong>, <strong>LoadGame</strong> and new <strong>CreateGame</strong> subroutines in the main program.  The question also relies on using the <strong>GetGridAsIndices</strong> method from task 5, including any methods called by that method.  Therefore it is best to begin your solution with the codebase that you ended task 5 with. <br /><br />

		Introduce a new command to the main menu that will allow a custom game to be created.  The user should be able to enter the grid size as a choice of 6, 8 (the current size) or 10 (and the board will be displayed for them to check – this is just a reuse of the code from task 5 and hence the final code from task 5 will be the starting point for this task), the location of a Baron for each player as well as the location of any additional pieces that they wish to add. They should be able to define which hexes contain lumber and peat bogs and define the starting resources (including supply chain) for each player.  There is no need to perform any validation on the data entry except for the grid size (which must be 6, 8 or 10).<br /><br />

		The prompts that should be given in this new subroutine (in order) are:

		<ul>
			<li>"Please enter the grid size (6, 8 or 10): "</li>
			<li>"Please enter all the locations of peat bogs separated by commands with no spaces: "</li>
			<li>"Please enter all the locations of forests separated by commands with no spaces:  </li>
			<li>"Please enter the location of the Baron for Player 1: "</li>
			<li>"Please enter the location of the Baron for Player 2:  </li>
			<li>"Please enter the starting amount of fuel for Player 1: "</li>
			<li>"Please enter the starting amount of fuel for Player 2: "</li>
			<li>"Please enter the starting amount of lumber for Player 1: "</li>
			<li>"Please enter the starting amount of lumber for Player 2: "</li>
			<li>"Please enter the starting amount of pieces for Player 1: "</li>
			<li>"Please enter the starting amount of pieces for Player 2: "</li>
			<li>"Please enter the starting amount of VPs for Player 1: "</li>
			<li>"Please enter the starting amount of VPs for Player 2:  </li>
			<li>"Enter piece to add for Player One (S=Serf, L=LESS, P=PBDS) or D for Done: "</li>
			<li>"Enter piece to add for Player Two (S=Serf, L=LESS, P=PBDS) or D for Done: "</li>
			<li>"What name would you like to save the file as (please include the extension): "</li>
			<li>"Would you like to play the game that you've created and saved?</li>
		</ul>

		If a piece is chosen by either player, the following prompt should be given:

		<ul>
			<li>"Enter the index of the hex where that piece should be placed: "</li>
		</ul>

		<strong>Note:</strong> There is a bug in the current <strong>LoadGame</strong> subroutine that you will also need to fix: it cannot handle the final hex of the terrain being a field; this needs to be corrected so that it is possible to have a field as the final hex.<br /><br />

		The game should automatically save in a file (it should prompt for the name) and then, once saved, the players should have the opportunity to play it immediately if they wish without having to type in the file name. For reference, see the game1.txt file supplied with the pre-release code; the format of the file is as follows (it is all comma-separated values):<br /><br />

		<div style="border:1px solid;">
		<p>Line 1: text for Player One’s name, Player One’s VPs, Player One’s fuel, Player One’s lumber, Player One’s supply chain</p>
		<p>Line 2: text for Player Two’s name, Player Two’s VPs, Player Two’s fuel, Player Two’s lumber, Player Two’s supply chain</p>
		<p>Line 3: board size</p>
		<p>Line 4: terrain list all separated by commas in index order</p>
		<p>Line 5+: one line for each piece on the board with the format: 1 or 2 to indicate the player number, piece name (case sensitive), index (board location)</p>
		</div>

		<ul>
			<li>Modify the <strong>DisplayMainMenu</strong> subroutine to add option 3. Create game.</li>
			<li>Modify the Main subroutine so that it calls a new subroutine <strong>CreateGame</strong> and then asks the player if they would like to load the game and then loads the game.  You will also need to modify the call <strong>LoadGame</strong> so that it accepts the file name as a parameter.</li>
			<li>Create a new subroutine called <strong>CreateGame</strong> which will create the file containing the game save and return two values, Success (as a Boolean) and FileName (the text name of the file created).</li>
			<li>Modify the <strong>LoadGame</strong> subroutine to correct the bug as described above.</li>

		<ol>
			<li>Introduce a GOD mode in which resources are infinite for both sides and nobody can die, once exited (using the command "godmode on" or "godmode off") then the game reverts to normal rules and the resources revert to their values before godmode was enabled.</li>
			<li>Create a computer controlled player</li>
			<li>Make the game more user-friendly so that each time any commands are processed a full description is give, e.g. 5 lumber deducted for upgrading PBDS in hex 12, or Serf has two connections from hexes 12 & 17 and was destroyed in hex 20.</li>
			<li>Introduce a new level of upgrade so that pbds and less pieces can be upgraded to super pbds and less pieces for a cost of 10 lumber but will now generate 2 resources for each dig or saw command.</li>
			<li>Introduce a new rule so that connections from your own pieces don’t kill you.</li>
			<li>Introduce an assassin piece that can use a kill command once per game but then it reverts to a serf, the kill command will kill the baron if it is next to it.</li>
			<li>Introduce a poison piece command so that each player can poison one piece per game, if a poisoned piece is killed the victim gains VPs instead of the killer.</li>
			<li>Introduce a random game command from the main menu where the board is randomly sized and resources are randomised (but fairly with suitable rules for distribution).</li>
			<li>Introduce a new blocking/wall piece that requires three connections to kill it (or possibly is also invincible for three turns).</li>
			<li>Change the rules so that the connection check for killing a piece is made after every move, instead of at the end of the turn.</li>
			<li>Add the ability to modify the terrain (for a cost), or have a new piece with this ability.</li>
			<li>Introduce ranged units that have connections only two edges away (instead of one).</li>
			<li>Introduce a mini serf (or pleb) piece that only costs 1 but cannot be upgraded and will be automatically killed if it ends the turn next to an enemy.  It also doesn’t cost you a piece from the supply chain to spawn.</li>
			<li>Have an advanced game mode whereby there is one trap square randomly on the board and any piece landing in it will be destroyed. Alternatively, give each player the opportunity to plant one trap on any field not adjacent to the opponent’s Baron, once per game.</li>
			<li>Change the rules so that you can choose to have an immovable Baron but in return get 1 extra lumber and 1 extra fuel every turn.</li>
			<li>Introduce a game timer so that each player has 180 seconds (or any configurable value using a constant or inputted variable) to enter their moves.  Failure to complete the move in time will result in the player forfeiting the remainder of their moves; whatever they have entered so far will be executed (if possible), after which it will become the other player’s turn.</li>
			<li>Add hit points for pieces to change the mechanic of when/how pieces are killed.</li>
			<li>Change the game so that the coordinates system is removed and distances are simply counted by the number of hexes that you need to move through.  The IDs should remain. The challenge here is working out / maintaining which tiles are neighbours.</li>
			<li>Change the game rules so that the game is terminated immediately if a Baron piece is destroyed. At the moment if Player 1 destroys Player 2’s Baron, they still get to play their turn.</li>
			<li>Change the victory rules at the end of the game so that once the game ends, each player gains VP for all of their remaining pieces according to the VP value for those pieces.</li>
